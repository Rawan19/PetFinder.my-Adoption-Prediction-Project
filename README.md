# PetFinder.my-Adoption-Speed-Prediction
*This is the final project for the deep learning course.*

In this competition you will predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the petâ€™s listing on PetFinder.  The data included text, tabular, sentiment, and image data.

## Image Metadata

We have run the images through Google's Vision API, providing analysis on Face Annotation, Label Annotation, Text Annotation and Image Properties. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your image analysis.

File name format is PetID-ImageNumber.json.

Some properties will not exist in JSON file if not present, i.e. Face Annotation. Text Annotation has been simplified to just 1 entry of the entire text description (instead of the detailed JSON result broken down by individual characters and words). Phone numbers and emails are already anonymized in Text Annotation.

## Sentiment Data

We have run each pet profile's description through Google's Natural Language API, providing analysis on sentiment and key entities. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your pet description analysis. There are some descriptions that the API could not analyze. As such, there are fewer sentiment files than there are rows in the dataset.

File name format is PetID.json.
